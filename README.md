# Introduction
Hello, this project contains whatever random python helper scripts I put together
to help try and cleanup/simplify saving and loading from json files in python. I
do not expect or suggest others try to use these in there current state but some
documentation on what is included is provided below.

# Documentation
There is currently only 1 script included in this project the 'config_manager.py'
witch provided a basic interface to programmatically define hooks to objects in the
project to be serialized. As well as managing the file paths for all linked objects.

## Config Manager system
*TODO*
